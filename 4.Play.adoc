== Play

=== Pre-game Practice

. When possible, teams will have access to practice fields for calibration and testing throughout the competition.

. Whenever there are dedicated independent fields for competition and practice, it is at the organizers' discretion if testing is allowed on the competition fields.

=== Humans

. Teams should designate one of their members as "captain" and another one as "co-captain". Only these two team members will be allowed access to the competition fields, unless otherwise directed by a referee. Only the captain will be allowed to interact with the robot during a scoring run.

. The captain can move the robot only when they are told to do so by a referee.

. Other team members (and any spectators) within the vicinity of the competition field have to stand at least 150 cm away from the field at all times, unless otherwise directed by a referee.

. No one is allowed to touch the fields intentionally during a scoring run.

. Any and all pre-mapping activities will result in immediate disqualification of the robot for the
round. Pre-mapping is the act of humans providing the robot with information about the field (e.g.:
location of walls, location of silver and black tiles, location and type of victims, etc.) prior to the game.

=== Start of Game

. Each team has a maximum of 8 minutes for a game. The game includes the time for calibration and the scoring run.

. Calibration is defined as the taking of sensor readings and modifying a robot’s program to
accommodate such sensor readings. Calibration does not count as pre-mapping.

. The scoring run is defined as the time when the robot is moving autonomously to navigate the field,
and the referee will record the scores.

. A game begins at the scheduled starting time whether or not the team is present or ready. Start times
will be posted around the venue.

. Once the game has begun, the robot is not permitted to leave the competition area.

. Teams may calibrate their robot in as many locations as desired on the field, but the clock will
continue to run. Robots are not permitted to move on their own while calibrating.

. Before a scoring run begins, the referee will roll a standard 6-sided dice or with another method of
randomization set by the organizers to determine the location of the black and silver tiles. The
position of the black and silver tiles will not be revealed to the team until they are ready to start a
scoring run (see 4.3.11). Referees will ensure the combination of black tile placements in a field
layout is 'solvable' before a robot begins a scoring run.

. Before a scoring run begins the referee can change any walls of the field, (see 2.3.6).

. Once a team is ready to start a scoring run, they must notify the referee. To begin a scoring run, the
robot is placed on the start tile of the course as indicated by the referee. Once a scoring run has
begun, no more calibration is permitted, including changing of code/code selection.

. Teams may choose not to calibrate the robot and instead immediately start the scoring run.

. Once the robot starts moving as the scoring run begins, a referee will place the black and silver tiles.

=== Scoring Run

. Modifying the robot during a scoring run is prohibited, which includes remounting parts that have fallen off.

. Any parts that the robot loses intentionally or unintentionally will be left in the field until the game is over. Team members and referees are not allowed to move or remove parts from the field during a scoring run.

. Teams are not allowed to give their robot any advance information about the field. A robot is supposed to recognize the field elements by itself.

. A "visited tile" means that more than half of the robot is inside the tile when looking from above.

=== Lack of Progress

. A lack of progress occurs when:
.. the team captain declares a lack of progress.
.. a robot visited the black tile. See definition of visited tile on 4.4.4.
.. a robot damages the field.
.. a team member touches the field or their robot without permission from a referee.

. In the event of a lack of progress, the robot must return to the last visited checkpoint (or the start tile if the robot has never reached a checkpoint). The robot can be installed in any direction. For the definition of the visited tile (see 4.4.4).

. After a lack of progress, the team must reset the robot by using a switch/button(s) located in a clearly visible location by the referee (see 3.2.10).

=== Scoring

. A robot can carry out one or both of the following actions to successfully identify a victim:

.. Stop for 5 seconds and blink an indicator which is visible to the referee for the full 5 seconds whilst being stationary. The visited tile must be equal to the victim tile while blinking. See definition of visited tile on rule 4.4.4.

.. Stop for 5 seconds and deploy a rescue kit (see 4.6.3). The visited tile must be equal to the victim tile while deploying the kit. See definition of visited tile on rule 4.4.4.

. 10 points are rewarded for each successful victim identification in the field:

. To successfully deploy a rescue kit, a robot must deploy (deployment point) a rescue kit on the victim tile. The deployment point is deemed to be the location where the rescue kit makes initial contact with the floor, it is not the final resting place of the rescue kit.

. 10 points are awarded per successful rescue kit deployment.

. Points will be awarded for victim identification and rescue kit deployment.

. Reliability Bonus = the number of ‘successful victim identification’ × 10 + the number of ‘successful rescue kit deployment’ × 10, minus the number of ‘Lack of Progress’ × 10. However, Reliability Bonus score can only be reduced to the minimum of 0 points.

. Successful Speed Bump Crossing. For each tile with speed bumps passed, a robot is awarded 5 points.

. Successful Up Ramp Negotiation. A robot is awarded 20 points for a successful climb up a ramp. To successfully climb up a ramp, a robot needs to move from the bottom horizontal tile before the ramp to the top horizontal tile after the ramp.

. Successful Down Ramp Negotiation. A robot is awarded 10 points for successfully landing at the bottom of a ramp. A robot needs to move from the top horizontal tile of the ramp to the bottom horizontal tile of the ramp. A successful landing means that the robot can leave the tile without assistance.

. Successful Checkpoint Negotiation.
.. A robot is awarded 10 points for each visited checkpoint. Refer to 4.4.4 for definition of visited tile.
.. Reaching a checkpoint in the first attempt is rewarded with 10 bonus points.
.. After three (3) Lack of Progress the robot is allowed to be placed on the next checkpoint. The robot is not awarded  points for checkpoints reached that way.

. Successful Exit Bonus. A robot is awarded 10 points for each victim successfully identified (see 4.6.1).
The "exit bonus" condition is satisfied when the robot returns to the starting tile, stays there for at least 10 seconds to complete the scoring run.

. Ties in scoring will be resolved based on the time each robot took to complete the run.

. No duplicate rewards. For example, if a robot successfully crosses a tile with speed bumps multiple times, only one successful speed bump crossing will be rewarded per tile. The same applies to all other scoring rules.

=== End of Game

. A team may elect to stop the game early at any time. In this case, the team captain must indicate to the referee the team's desire to terminate the game. The team will be awarded all points earned up to the call for the end of the game. The referee will stop the time at the end of game which will be recorded as the game time.

. The game ends when:
.. the 8 minutes of allowed game time expires.
.. the team captain calls end of game.
.. the robot returns to the start tile and is awarded the exit bonus.
